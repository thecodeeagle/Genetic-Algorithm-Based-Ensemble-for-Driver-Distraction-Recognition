# Genetic-Algorithm-Weighted-Ensemble-of-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Driver-Distraction-Recognition
The current repository, based on my project on driver distraction detection, proposes a solution for the existing problem by constructing an "ensemble" or "comination" of deep learning networks, consisting of :
* AlexNet
* Vanilla CNN
* Hierarchical Model of DenseNet-201( Adopted from YogaPose Variations)
* EfficientNet B0
* InceptionV3 Coupled with BiDirectional LSTM's
* Original VGG16 as feature extractor
